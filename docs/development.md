# Local development

Use Node.js 22.19.0 or newer and pnpm 11.5.3. Building native plugins also requires Rhino 8.20 or newer running .NET 8 and the .NET 8 SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsoumdoa/hoppercode.git
cd hoppercode
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm install` installs dependencies without building or installing Rhino plugins. `pnpm dev` opens the web UI at `http://localhost:5174/#mock-running` with an in-memory mock host. It needs no Rhino, .NET, model credentials, or real backend. Messages receive canned replies. Reload with `#mock-question`, `#mock-failed`, or `#mock-empty` to try the other fixtures. Threads and settings stay in memory until you stop development with Ctrl+C. Tabs using the same fixture share threads, and reconnecting preserves them. Restart `pnpm dev` to reset the fixtures.

The mock supports thread archive/delete, questions, cancellation, recovery, image attachments, provider sign-in simulation, tool settings, skills, and conversation export. It uses the real request validators. Provider sign-in and plugin keys are simulated; submitted keys are discarded. It does not run Rhino operations or model calls, and stopping the host remains a terminal action.

The main commands are:

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `pnpm install` | Install dependencies |
| `pnpm dev` | Open the UI with mock data and hot reload |
| `pnpm build` | Build and verify macOS arm64 and Windows x64 Yak packages |
| `pnpm build --dev` | Compile host and UI into `dist` with source maps, without packaging |
| `pnpm build:install` | Build, verify, and replace the local Rhino 8 installation |
| `pnpm test` | Run the test suite |

Release builds require .NET and Rhino 8's Yak executable. `pnpm build` builds both platforms sequentially and writes to `artifacts/hopper-pi-<version>-<target>`. It refuses a nonempty output directory. Use `pnpm build --output artifacts/my-release` for another destination; each target gets its own `mac-arm64` or `win-x64` subfolder. `--target mac-arm64` and `--target win-x64` remain available for a single target. Cross-built packages still need runtime testing on their target OS.

For local development, quit Rhino and run `pnpm build:install`. It builds only the current platform, verifies and smoke-tests a fresh package, stops the old Hopper host, and replaces the installed package without prompting. Each run uses a new staging directory, so repeated local builds need no output cleanup. Saved conversations remain available. Both platforms accept the same options:

```bash
pnpm build:install --open-rhino  # Install, then reopen Rhino
pnpm build:install --build-only # Build and smoke-test without changing the installation
```

`pnpm build --dev` is useful for debugging the compiled host or checking the built UI. It requires only JavaScript dependencies and writes source maps for both. For UI iteration with hot reload, use `pnpm dev`.

## Use the real host with hot reload

For real backend work, compile the assets and start the host:

```bash
pnpm build --dev
node dist/host/index.js --ensure-host --explicit-start --ui-dev-origin http://localhost:5173
```

Run `pnpm exec vite` in a second terminal. Vite reads the host endpoint from `~/.hopper/shared-control/control.json`. Start the host before Vite so the endpoint is available. `HOPPER_UI_PROXY_TARGET` can override it. If another host is already running, stop it through its browser UI before starting the rebuilt host with development-origin access.

Run `HopperCode` in Rhino to attach its documents. To authenticate the development page, open the private `~/.hopper/shared-control/control.json` locally and copy its `browserCredential` value into `http://localhost:5173/#<browserCredential>`. The browser removes the fragment after reading it. Keep this credential private; do not paste it into logs, screenshots, issues, or chat. The normal HopperCode workflow opens an authenticated link automatically and needs none of these development steps.

Diagnostic utilities remain available directly, for example `node scripts/verify-rhino-package.mjs` and `pnpm exec tsx scripts/cross-language-rpc-smoke.ts`.
